C++/LSTM compatibility done by Diandong Tang.

To run this code, please:

(1) download and compile Keras2C (https://github.com/f0uriest/keras2c), to get static library <code>libkeras2c.a</code>.
    please place <code>libkeras2c.a</code> into your LSTM-FSSH directory(same as <code>main.c</code>).

(2) place <code>/include</code> folder of Keras2C into your LSTM-FSSH directory.

(3) run <code>./make</code>.
