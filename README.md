C Programming by JiaLY;\n
C++/LSTM compatibility done by TangDD.

To run this code, please:

(1) download and compile Keras2C (https://github.com/f0uriest/keras2c), to get static library 'libkeras2c.a'.
    please place 'libkeras2c.a' into your LSTM-FSSH directory(same as main.c).

(2) place /include folder of Keras2C into your LSTM-FSSH directory.

(3) run ./make.
